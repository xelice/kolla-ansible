    Make use of quorum queues for transient/fanout queues.
    This helps OpenStack services to be more resilient to message broker
    failures.
    This feature is disabled by default.
    You can enable it by setting the following in your ``globals.yml``:
    ``om_enable_rabbitmq_transient_quorum_queue: true``.
    Notice that this enables quorum queues for all transient/fanout message
    exchanges and likely improves the resilience of the system.
